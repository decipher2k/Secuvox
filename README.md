<b><font size="4">Secuvox Browser is a webbrower on steroids!</font></b><br>
=============================================<br>
Secuvox blocks functions which ad networks do use to track your surfing behaviour and to create profiles of your person.<br>
Did you ever wonder why those ads do know your preferences? You scroll to an article in the news, read it - and bam, you get contextual ads.<br>
They can't read your mind, if you're worried about that. All they do is to monitor your scrolling- and mouse movement behaviour.<br>
<br>
This is where Secuvox comes into play. It keeps ad networks from being able to programatically track your surfing behaviour.<br>
You can select what kinds of information to block per page: Mouse movement, scrolling, or generic events.<br>
<br>
In adition, Secuvox pretends to be the Google bot. Thus, many cookie banners and tracking function will vanish.<br>
It does also send "Do not track" headers and block ads as well as most cookie banners.<br>
Referer data (that's information about what webpage has led you to another webpage) is also being blocked.<br>
<br>
Sevuvox does have two kinds of adblockers implemented: UblockOrigin as well as a host based filter list to provide even more privacy!<br>
<br>
All this comes with a small cost, as allways in life:<br>
First of all, some webpages may be display badly. That's due to the nature of webdesign, and which techniques ad companies do use.<br>
To solve this, you can select specifically which tracking features you want to block per webpage.<br>
Second of all, second media can't be blocked. That's due to the nature of it being relying on endless scrolling. As soon as a page relies on endless scrolling, it is dependant of monitoring scroll behaviour.<br>
Thus, the blocking features are disabled for most social media pages.<br>
<br>
